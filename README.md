# Legal-Document-Analyzer-Spring-Boot
 
Project Overview: AI-Powered Legal Document Analyzer

The AI-Powered Legal Document Analyzer is a backend application designed to help legal
professionals, businesses, and individuals analyze legal documents efficiently. This tool
leverages AI/ML to identify high-risk clauses, ambiguous terms, and potential compliance
issues in legal documents such as contracts, agreements, and policies. It provides actionable
recommendations for mitigating risks and ensures that the document aligns with legal and
regulatory standards.

Why Build This Project?

Legal document analysis is often tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error. With
the increasing complexity of legal language and the volume of contracts that businesses
handle, there is a critical need for automation in this domain. By building this project:

1. Efficiency: It automates the review process, reducing the time needed to analyze
documents.
2. Risk Mitigation: Identifies high-risk clauses, helping businesses avoid legal disputes.
3. Scalability: Enables organizations to handle large volumes of legal documents
without hiring additional staff.
4. Accessibility: Provides individuals and small businesses access to affordable legal
insights.
This tool is ideal for law firms, startups, compliance teams, and anyone who regularly works
with legal documents.
